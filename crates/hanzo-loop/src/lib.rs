//! What a controller decides inside the agent loop, as data the loop applies.
//!
//! The loop asks at three points and applies the answer: which tools the model sees directly
//! this step, whether a command may run, and which routing hints ride the turn's requests. A
//! controller installed on the thread answers. Nothing it says can loosen what the loop already
//! decided: a verdict joins the policy's on `allow < ask < deny`, a shortlist only moves tools
//! out of direct view, and a hint is metadata the gateway may read.
//!
//! The loop finds the controller as a [`Handle`] in the thread's extension data. The patched
//! upstream calls in `patches/upstream.json` are the only readers.
