//! The version this process runs as: one value, set by the binary, read everywhere.
//!
//! A release names its version to the binary crate alone, as `DEV_VERSION` at
//! build time, and that crate's `main` hands it here before anything reads it.
//! Every other crate asks at run time. So a new release recompiles the binary
//! crate and nothing beneath it, and the compiled graph below it is the same
//! from one release to the next. `make prepare` routes upstream's
//! `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` here.
