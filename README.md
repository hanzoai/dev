## Quickstart

### Run

```bash
npx -y @hanzo/dev
```

### Install & Run

```bash
npm install -g @hanzo/dev
dev
```

**Authenticate** (one of the following):
- **Sign in with ChatGPT** (Plus/Pro/Team; uses models available to your plan)
  - Run `dev` and pick "Sign in with ChatGPT"
  - Stores creds locally at `~/.coder/auth.json` (also reads legacy `~/.codex/auth.json`)
- **API key** (usage-based)
  - Set `export OPENAI_API_KEY=xyz` and run `dev`

### Install Claude & Gemini (optional)

Hanzo Dev supports orchestrating other AI CLI tools. Install these and config to use alongside Hanzo Dev.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code @google/gemini-cli && claude "Just checking you're working! Let me know how I can exit." && gemini -i "Just checking you're working! Let me know how I can exit."
```

&ensp;
## Commands

### Browser
```bash
# Connect to external Chrome browser (running CDP)
/chrome        # Connect with auto-detect port
/chrome 9222   # Connect to specific port

# Switch to internal browser mode
/browser       # Use internal headless browser
/browser https://example.com  # Open URL in internal browser
```

### Agents
```bash
# Plan code changes (Claude, Gemini and GPT-5 consensus)
# All agents review task and create a consolidated plan
/plan "Stop the AI from ordering pizza at 3AM"

# Solve complex problems (Claude, Gemini and GPT-5 race)
# Fastest preferred (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17813)
/solve "Why does deleting one user drop the whole database?"

# Write code! (Claude, Gemini and GPT-5 consensus)
# Creates multiple worktrees then implements the optimal solution
/code "Show dark mode when I feel cranky"
```

### General
```bash
# Try a new theme!
/themes

# Change reasoning level
/reasoning low|medium|high

# Start new conversation
/new
```

## CLI reference

```shell
dev [options] [prompt]

Options:
  --model <name>        Override the model (gpt-5, claude-opus, etc.)
  --read-only          Prevent file modifications
  --no-approval        Skip approval prompts (use with caution)
  --config <key=val>   Override config values
  --oss                Use local open source models
  --sandbox <mode>     Set sandbox level (read-only, workspace-write, etc.)
  --help              Show help information
  --debug             Log API requests and responses to file
  --version           Show version number
```

&ensp;
## Memory & project docs

Hanzo Dev can remember context across sessions:

1. **Create an `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` file** in your project root:
```markdown
# Project Context
This is a React TypeScript application with:
- Authentication via JWT
- PostgreSQL database
- Express.js backend

## Key files:
- `/src/auth/` - Authentication logic
- `/src/api/` - API client code  
- `/server/` - Backend services
```

2. **Session memory**: Hanzo Dev maintains conversation history
3. **Codebase analysis**: Automatically understands project structure

&ensp;
## Non-interactive / CI mode

For automation and CI/CD:

```shell
# Run a specific task
dev --no-approval "run tests and fix any failures"

# Generate reports
dev --read-only "analyze code quality and generate report"

# Batch processing
dev --config output_format=json "list all TODO comments"
```

&ensp;
## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Hanzo Dev supports MCP for extended capabilities:

- **File operations**: Advanced file system access
- **Database connections**: Query and modify databases
- **API integrations**: Connect to external services
- **Custom tools**: Build your own extensions

Configure MCP in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[[mcp_servers]]
name = "filesystem"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/project"]
```

&ensp;
## Configuration

Main config file: `~/.codex/config.toml`

```toml
# Model settings
model = "gpt-5"
model_provider = "openai"

# Behavior
approval_policy = "on_request"  # untrusted | on-failure | on-request | never
model_reasoning_effort = "medium" # low | medium | high
sandbox_mode = "workspace_write"

# UI preferences see THEME_CONFIG.md
[tui.theme]
name = "light-photon"

# Add config for specific models
[profiles.gpt-5]
model = "gpt-5"
model_provider = "openai"
approval_policy = "never"
model_reasoning_effort = "high"
model_reasoning_summary = "detailed"
```

### Environment variables

- `CODEX_HOME`: Override config directory location
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Use API key instead of ChatGPT auth
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL`: Use alternative API endpoints
